        <h1>Mathematical Formulas</h1>
        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
        </p>
        <p class="formula-p"><span class="formula">ax + b = 0</span></p>
        <p>
            where <span class="red_letters">a</span> and <span class="red_letters">b</span> are real
            numbers and <span class="red_letters">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes
            called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations
            will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="red_letters">x</span>
            so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="red_letters">x</span> there.
        </p>
        <h3>Quadratic Equations</h3>
        <p>
            The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
        </p>
        <p class="formula-p"><span class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> &plus; bx &plus; c &equals; 0</span></p>
        <p>
            where <span class="red_letters">a</span>, <span class="red_letters">b</span>,
            <span class="red_letters">c</span> are known values and <span class="red_letters">x</span>
            is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="red_letters">a</span>
            can't be <span class="red_letters">0</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <p><span class="red_letters">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="red_letters">r</span>) squared:</p>
        <p class="formula-p"><span class="formula">A &equals; <span>&pi;</span> &times; r<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="red_letters">D</span>):</p>
        <p class="formula-p"><span class="formula">A &equals; (<span>&pi;</span> &divide; 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="red_letters">C</span>):</p>
        <p class="formula-p"><span class="formula">A &equals; C<sup>2</sup> &divide; 4 &times; <span>&pi;</span></span></p>
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="red_letters">A</span> and <span class="red_letters">B</span>, denoted
            by <span class="red_letters">A</span> &#8745; <span class="red_letters">B</span>, is the set of all objects that
            are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
        <p class="formula-p"><span class="formula"> A &#8745; B &equals; &lcub; x : x &#8712; A and x &#8712; B &rcub;</span></p>
        <p>That is, <span class="red_letters">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only
            if <span class="red_letters">x</span> is both an element of <span class="red_letters">A</span> and an element
            of <span class="red_letters">B</span>.</p>
