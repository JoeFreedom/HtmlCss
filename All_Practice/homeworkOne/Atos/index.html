            <h2>Randomly generated story about Clarke and Simon</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Chapter One</h3>
                Clarke Gobble was thinking about Simon Willis again. Simon was a gracious gamer with pointy 
                toenails and fragile spots. Clarke walked over to the window and reflected on his pretty surroundings. 
                He had always loved industrial Manchester with its helpless, heavy hills. It was a place that encouraged 
                his tendency to feel stressed. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a 
                gracious figure of Simon Willis. Clarke gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a cute, 
                tactless, squash drinker with pointy toenails and red spots. His friends saw him as a warm, weak writer. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
                Once, he had even helped a thankful puppy recover from a flying accident.
                But not even a cute person who had once helped a thankful puppy recover from a flying accident, was prepared for
                what Simon had in store today. The moon shone like loving elephants, making Clarke worried. Clarke grabbed a 
                stripy sausage that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers. As Clarke stepped outside and 
                Simon came closer, he could see the calm glint in his eye. Simon gazed with the affection of 7742 modest gleaming 
                giraffes. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a wifi code." Clarke looked back, even more worried 
                andstill fingering the stripy sausage. "Simon, I admire your eyebrows," he replied. They looked at each other 
                with barmy feelings, like two pleasant, sprecious puppies thinking at a very courageous Halloween party, which 
                had jazz music playing in the background and two thoughtless uncles eating to the beat.
            </p>   
                
            <p>
                <h3>Chapter Three</h3>
                Suddenly, Simon lunged forward and tried to punch Clarke in the face. Quickly, Clarke grabbed the stripy sausage 
                and brought it down on Simon's skull. Simon's pointy toenails trembled and his fragile spots wobbled. He looked 
                angry, his emotions raw like a narrow, nice newspaper.
                Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Simon Willis was dead.
                Clarke Gobble back inside and made himself a nice beaker of squash. 
                <br><br>THE END<br><br>

            <h2>What Are Articles?</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>The Definite Article</h3>
                The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing.
                For example, your friend might ask, “Are you going to the party this weekend?” The definite 
                article tells you that your friend is referring to a specific party that both of you know about. 
                The definite article can be used with singular, plural, or uncountable nouns. Below are some 
                examples of the definite article the used in context: 
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>The Indefinite Article</h3>
                The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant.
                It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article indicates that a noun
                refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring 
                a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific
                item. “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is
                not talking about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article  
                only appears with singular nouns. Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>Choosing A or An</h3> 
                There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words 
                that begin with vowels. The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced. In spite
                of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use an. Consider the example sentence below for an
                illustration of this concept.<br><br>

            <h2>Forum: Commission launches political debate towards strengthening Schengen and restoring trust</h2>
            <time>Written on 01-01-2021 </time> <br>
            <p>
                <h3>Part One: Pre-Meeting</h3>
                On Monday, 30 November, the Commission will convene the first ever Schengen Forum, gathering Members of  
                European Parliament and Home Affairs Ministers, and aiming to foster concrete cooperation and political 
                dialogue to address current challenges and build a more resilient Schengen area. The discussions will 
                inform the Strategy for a stronger Schengen area to be presented in mid-2021. Topics for discussion include
                strengthening the governance of the Schengen area and improving the mechanism to evaluate the implementation 
                of the Schengen rules, drawing lessons from the experience of the coronavirus pandemic and discussing the role of 
                Schengen in the post-coronavirus economic recovery phase, finding a way forward on the revision of the Schengen
                Borders Code, making better use of alternative measures to the reintroduction of border controls, better managing 
                the EU's external borders, as well as enhancing police cooperation and information exchange.                
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Part Two: A little bit more about the meeting</h3>
                The meeting will start at 9.00 CET with a message from President Ursula von der Leyen on the occasion of the 35th 
                anniversary of the Schengen area. Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, will 
                deliver opening remarks, followed by a keynote address by Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson. The Chair
                of the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs' working group on Schengen Scrutiny, 
                Tanja Fajon, will also give a keynote address. The meeting will be held via videoconference. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Part Three: Use of data in public procurement involving EU funds</h3>
                The European Commission, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Open Contracting Partnership 
                are joining forces to improve the quality and transparency of public tenders co-funded by EU funds in Greece and Poland.  
                Two pilot projects will provide expertise and hands-on support to public authorities in both countries, with a focus on 
                digital innovation in order to allow public administrations better plan, implement and monitor the procurement of works, 
                goods and services, improving the use of public resources and increasing opportunities for businesses, especially for small 
                and medium companies (SMEs). Moreover, thanks to a cooperation with local civil society organisations, this initiative will 
                also favour transparency of public spending. The two pilots will run until the end of 2021 and their results will be disseminated.
